# AI-Speech-Emotion-Detection üéôÔ∏èü§ñ

Welcome to our Emotion Detection from Speech project! This open-source endeavor is dedicated to accurately detecting emotions from spoken language, utilizing a comprehensive pipeline that begins with speech-to-text transcription. We leverage state-of-the-art open-source models and APIs, including the renowned Open AI Whisper model, to convert spoken words into textual representations.

## Overview

- **Speech-to-Text Transcription:** Utilizing open-source models and APIs such as Open AI Whisper, we transcribe spoken words into textual representations.
- **Text Processing:** The transcribed text undergoes meticulous processing using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a bag-of-words model to extract emotions.
- **Machine Learning Classification:** Various machine learning classification algorithms, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, CatBoost, and XGBoost, contribute to robust emotion categorization.
- **Ensemble Methods for Classification:** To enhance accuracy, we employ Ensemble Methods for Classification, combining multiple algorithms for improved performance.

## Getting Started

Explore our repository to access the codebase, detailed documentation, and resources for implementing and enhancing emotion detection from speech. The project is designed to be user-friendly, allowing developers to easily understand and integrate the provided solutions.



## Methodology

The core of our methodology involves meticulous processing of transcribed text to extract emotions. We employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a bag-of-words model to unravel the emotional nuances embedded in the speech. Machine learning classification algorithms, ranging from traditional models such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression to advanced techniques like CatBoost and XGBoost, contribute to the robust categorization of emotions.

To elevate accuracy and ensure a nuanced understanding of emotional states, we harness the power of Ensemble Methods for Classification. The combination of multiple machine learning algorithms through ensemble techniques enhances the overall performance of our emotion detection model.
